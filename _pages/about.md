## Hi I am Tianyi Chen!

I am currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics department at Johns Hopkins University. I have the privilege of being mentored by [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I also work closely with [Youngser Park](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/), Avanti Athreya and [Zachary Lubberts](https://sites.google.com/view/zachary-lubberts). Prior to this, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China under the guidance of Professors [Yang Li](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/1f8dc586ac2f4ed58593a03c5d37bc1e.htm), [Feifei Wang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/2ded6adf269343c090a1837426d06078.htm), and [Xing Wang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/bc3d62d0bb2f40eea0ac93da96b1dbd5.htm).

My research interests span across classical statistics and machine learning, particularly through the lens of mathematical perspectives. I am currently involved in research on [localizing first-order changepoint in the time series of networks with a novel embedding method we called Euclidean Mirror](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11111). 

I am keen on providing statistical consulting services to researchers from a wide array of disciplines. At present, I am collaborating with neuroscientists to apply our method to brain Organoid MEA data. More details can be found [here](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-023-00564-5).

In addition to my study of statistics, I have a broader interest in the pursuit of varied forms of knowledge. I'm always excited about new experiences. I have a deep appreciation for movies and literature, and during my undergraduate, I, along with my incredible friends, produced a [short movie](https://v.qq.com/x/page/m0196i70neu.html) and a [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9OxAO_TmX4). Additionally, I have a passion for philosophy, psychology, and learning about the natural world...(updated July 18 2024)
