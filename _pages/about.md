======
This is Tianyi Chen. A third year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins applied math and statistics department. I am fortunate to be advised by [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). During my undergraduate, I majored in statistics at Renmin University of China and I was advised by my professors Yang Li, Feifei Wang and Xing Wang.

-------
Now I am interested in classical statistics and of course, machine learning(but from a classical statistics or math perspective).
